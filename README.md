1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed- This will allow me to catch errors in the code before I complete the whole process so I can immediately fix the error and prevent everything from breaking later. This is also less tedious than running code manually and it is not time consuming at all. It is always better to catch an error as soon as possible, i.e. as soon as it is pushed, so that after completing the entire app, we do not realize that we have too many errors to fix at once.
2. No, we should no use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output as e2e runs the entire program. 
3. No. In the case of the "message" feature, it would be more appropriate to use end to end tests. 
4. Yes. The reason is that the "max message length" feature can be tested independently and in isolation from other components.
